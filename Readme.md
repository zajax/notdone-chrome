# Not Done, Done Chrome Extension

This is a Google Chrome extension that connects to and can create issues on getdonedone.com for your registered account. Obviously that means you need to have an account on DoneDone, and you need to have Google Chrome.


Note: Currently, this is a proof of concept state.
